# Ask What Matters: Adaptive AI for Smarter Travel Reviews

## Competition Workbook

*This workbook is designed to help your team plan, design, and build your submission for the Hack-AI-thon. Use it as a guide to structure decisions, document assumptions, and prepare deliverables. Your final submission must follow the Hack-AI-thon Submission Requirements.*

# Your Challenge

This year’s business challenge tasks teams with creating a tool to enhance the review process both for existing guests leaving reviews on properties (e.g., hotels) and for future guests seeking current, complete information before they travel. For guests leaving reviews, this system should dynamically generate personalized questions for users, delivered via voice or text, that are smooth and easy to interact with. This tool should help to fill specific data gaps or refresh information about properties to ensure review information is current and complete for future guests. This aims to increase the quantity and quality of reviews while reducing user cognitive load.

Reviews are rich, but inconsistent: some topics are over-covered, some are missing, and some get stale fast (amenities change, renovations happen, policies shift). Static review prompts don’t adapt. Your challenge is to build a system that **detects what matters for a specific property right now** and **generates** **low-friction questions** to fill those gaps.

## What you’re building

Build a prototype that asks a traveler **1–2 smart follow-up questions** while they leave a review (via text or voice input). The goal is to **collect missing or outdated info** about a property while **prioritizing a smooth experience** for reviewers.

Think: “What information is unknown or outdated about this property, and what’s the easiest way to learn it?”

A strong solution will:

* Identify what information is missing or stale for a given property  
* Ask 1-2 questions that directly target those gaps  
* Collect answers from travelers in a low-friction way (via voice or text) as part of the property review process  
* Show how those answers could improve the property’s information

## 

## Submission Overview

Your submission will include your team’s working prototype and supporting materials:

* **Prototype link**: a single, public link where the prototype can be viewed and tested  
* **Project repository link**: all code is open source and in a GitHub repo submitted to our GitHub Classroom  
* **Demo video (3-5 minutes, recorded in real time)**: your video is a key part of your submission—use it to bring your project to life. Your video should be a mp4/avi walkthrough clearly showing judges the problem, approach, and key functionality of your tool and prototype, and must be recorded in real time (sped-up videos are disqualified)  
* **Pitch deck (8-12 slides, supporting 10-minute presentation)**: Your team’s slide deck should clearly and efficiently support your live finals presentation and demo, helping judges quickly understand the problem addressed by your tool, your AI-driven solution, technical approach and demo flow, and why it matters. These will be the slides used if your team advances to finals.  
* **Supporting materials (optional)**: additional documentation, slides, citations, or PDFs that help reviewers understand the tool. Any data used should be publicly-available and cited.

## Submission Requirements & Details

Submissions for the Hack-AI-Thon are due in [SurveyMonkey Apply](https://analyticsatwharton.smapply.io/prog/2026_wharton_hack-ai-thon/) by **Thursday, April 16 at 9:00 AM ET**. Late submissions will not be considered. All submission materials must be submitted by your Team Leader (the person who registered your team for the competition).

Your submission will include:

## **1\. Link to your project/tool prototype**

Submissions must include a live link to your working prototype. We've intentionally kept the hosting choice flexible, so that students can use the tools they are most familiar with. Judging will be entirely platform-agnostic. 

Not sure which platform to use? The WAIAI Data team recommends the following free hosting sites: Vercel, GitHub Pages, Hugging Face Spaces, and Replit. *Important Note*: You may need to fork your Hack-AI-thon GitHub Classroom repo in order to host your app on certain platforms – you will still need to submit your final project code via GitHub Classroom.

**2\. Link to your project repository in GitHub Classroom**

All code for your tool should be shared in a GitHub repository via GitHub Classroom. Your GitHub repository will have an MIT License by default– please do not change this setting, your repository must retain this license in order for your team to advance. Any materials in your team’s GitHub repository should be ready to be shared publicly, so must not contain any OpenAI API keys as described in the Data Use Agreement.

**3\. Your team’s 3–5 minute video presentation**

Your video is a key part of your submission—use it to bring your project to life. The video should be 3–5 minutes max and clearly walk judges through your solution approach, and key functionality of your tool and prototype. 

*Recommended Outline*:

1. **Problem & Context**: Why this matters. Briefly explain the core business problem you’re tackling and what insight, frustration, or opportunity motivated your team’s approach.  
2. **Your AI Solution**: What you built. Why this works. Clearly describe how your system addresses the business challenge and where and why AI is essential to your approach. Be explicit about assumptions you’re making about the data you have access to.  
3. **Demo or Walkthrough**: Show how your prototype works, highlighting key features and user experience.  
4. **Feasibility & Scalability**: Can this actually work? Briefly discuss how your approach could scale, any limitations of your current prototype, and what you intentionally did not try to solve.  
5. **Wrap-Up**: Why your project stands out. End with a clear summary of what makes your approach to the business challenge different or better.

*Tips for a Strong Video*

* Keep it focused and clear—reviewers should immediately understand what challenge you are solving and how.  
* Show the actual interface or user experience, even if it's a prototype.  
* Speak with energy and clarity—your passion helps sell the idea.  
* Use subtitles or captions if possible (not required, but helpful).  
* Don’t stress about high production value—substance and clarity matter more.

*Videos must be recorded in real time. **Sped-up videos will be disqualified**.*

Upload your demo video (mp4 or avi, 3–5 minutes, maximum file size 1GB) in the SurveyMonkey Apply submission form.

**4\. Upload your pitch slide deck**

Your slide deck should clearly and efficiently support your live finals presentation and demo, helping judges quickly understand the business problem, your AI-driven solution, and why it matters. Aim for no more than 8–12 slides that tell a coherent story from problem context to impact, balancing clarity for non-technical judges with enough technical depth to justify your design choices. Slides should prioritize structure, diagrams, and examples over dense text, and clearly set up the demo flow the judges are about to see. This deck will be used if your team advances to the finals. Plan for a presentation that’s about 10 minutes long, with 5 minutes for Q\&A.

*Your deck should cover*:

* The core problem and why static review questions fail  
* Your solution and where it fits in the review experience  
* How AI is used to identify gaps and generate targeted questions  
* A simple system workflow or architecture  
* Demo flow and expected user experience  
* User and business impact  
* Feasibility, scalability, and key limitations  
* Why your approach stands out

**5\. Any supporting resources, information, or materials (optional)**

Add any additional links, resources, or information you would like the judges to consider. Any data used should be publicly-available and cited.
